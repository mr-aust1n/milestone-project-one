## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

| Page | W3C URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Main Page | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fboderg.github.io%2Fyour-weather%2F) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/nu-html-checker-warnings.png) | Section lacks header h2-h6 warning |
| Main Page | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fboderg.github.io%2Fyour-weather%2F) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/nu-html-checker-warnings.png) | Modal not allowed as child of body error |
| Main Page | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fboderg.github.io%2Fyour-weather%2F) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/nu-html-checker-no-errors.png) | Fixed by adding an h1 heading and changing modal to div - Pass: No Errors or Warnings |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

| File | Jigsaw URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| style.css | [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fboderg.github.io%2Fyour-weather%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/w3c-css-validator-results.png) | Pass: No Errors |

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.

| File | Screenshot | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| main.js | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/jshint-validation-warnings.png) | Missing semicolons |
| main.js | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/jshint-validation-pass.png) | Pass: No Errors |

## Accessibility

I have tested my deployed project using the [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) web accessibility evaluation tool to check for any accessibility issues.

| Page | Summary | Details | Contrast | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Main | ![screenshot](documentation/wave/wave-summary.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/wave/wave-details.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/wave/wave-contrast.png) | A couple of minor notes about one label being missing from the search input field and a label missing from the search button, these were intentional as both items are titled and the input field has a placeholder. |

## Lighthouse Audit

I have tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

| Page | Mobile | Desktop | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Main | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse-audit-mobile.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse-audit-desktop.png) | Few minor warnings about load times on mobile |

- To improve the SEO score I have added a description meta tag to the HTML file.
- To improve the accessibility score I added titles to the buttons in the html file.

## Defensive Programming

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

| Page | Expectation | Test | Result | Fix | Screenshot |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

| | The site is expected to fetch and display the weather data when the input field is populated and the 'Enter' key is pressed. | Tested the feature by entering various city and town names and pressing the 'Enter' key. | The feature did not respond to the 'Enter' key being pressed. | I added a keydown event listener for the 'Enter' key that would call the getWeather() function when pressed. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/enter-pressed.png) |
| | The Temperature toggle is expected to switch the weather data between metric and imperial measurements by calling the relevant api data. | Tested the feature by clicking on the toggle switch. | The feature behaved as expected. | Test concluded and passed | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/metric.png) ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/imperial.png) |
| | The GitHub link in the footer is expected to open my main GitHub page in a new browser tab. | Tested the feature by clicking the link. | The feature behaved as expected. | Test concluded and passed. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/my-github.png) |
| About Modal | | | | | |

## Bugs

The following are bugs that I have come across while creating the Your Weather site.

- Timezone displayed instead of city - The data being displayed was pulled from the timezone and not the city name.

| Original image | Bug fixed image |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/miami-new-york-timezone.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/miami-city.png) |
| ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/hendon-london-timezone.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/hendon-town.png)

- To fix this I removed the const variable that was calling that data from the api enabling the HTML to use the place name from the input field instead.

***

- Initial Sunrise and Sunset times displayed as GMT timezone.

| Original image | Bug fixed image |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/sunrise-set-gmt-date.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/sunrise-set-timezone-offset.png)

- To fix this I added a timezone offset and formatted the data to display only the time for the timezone of the city requested.

***

- Mixed content - This error prevented the deployed site from loading the weather data from the api.
- To fix this error I found he fix on MDN web docs and I edited all links that displayed as http:// to https://.

***

- Uncaught in promise error (network error) - This error was preventing the deployed site from fetching any data from the api but only while using Firefox, it was fine on other browsers.
- To fix this error I tried adding a catch to the geolocation api fetch but this broke the site. After a little research it turned out that by turning off the ad blocker extension I had on firefox the api was then able to fetch the data.

***

- Favicon would not display on GitHub pages deployed site, but would show locally.
- To fix this, I first tried changing the image, then changing the image name, but these did not fix the issue and after a little research it was noted that the link to where the image was located needed to have a '.' at the start of the link.

## Unfixed Bugs

| Error | Screenshot | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Permission policy error - Chrome devtools gives this google floc warning on the version that I am using. It appears to be a deprecated trial for data collection instead of using cookies. | ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/google-floc-warning.png) | I was unsuccessful at fixing this, however this does not affect the operation of the site and this trial operation is also blocked by GitHub as it breaks privacy policy. |
| The 404 page does not pick up the css if an error is created on the end of a .html url. | e.g. boderg.github.io/your-weather/index.html/data ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/html-error.png) | I was unable to fix this error but the 404 error does appear and the link button does work to return to the main page. I feel this is acceptable as it is an unlikely scenario to enter a url in this fashion. |

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
